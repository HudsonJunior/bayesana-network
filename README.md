# Bayesana Network

This project explores **Bayesian Networks** using **Python**. Bayesian Networks are probabilistic graphical models that represent dependencies among variables, useful in reasoning under uncertainty. This project serves as an introduction to Bayesian Network principles and demonstrates their application in machine learning.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Uses datasets to construct and analyze Bayesian models.
- **Probabilistic Inference**: Calculates probabilities for different scenarios based on network dependencies.

This project supports my understanding of Bayesian inference and probabilistic reasoning.
